React Frontend Boilerplate
==========================

A simple frontend only boilerplate for quick/easy react experimenting.
Built with [Innovative Design](http://innovativedesign.club) web tier in mind.

This boilerplate will try to keep up to date with the newest tools (e.g. `react-hot-loader@3.0.0.beta6`)
